# ChatGPT: The Wolf Expansion — Roadmap

> **Status:** Planning / pre-development  
> **Primary browsers:** Firefox, Floorp  
> **Possible later support:** Chromium-based browsers  
> **License goal:** Fully free and open source  
> **Paid features:** None  
> **Subscriptions:** None  
> **Accounts required by the extension:** None

## Project Principle

**ChatGPT: The Wolf Expansion** is a power-user quality-of-life extension for ChatGPT.

The goal is to enhance ChatGPT without replacing it with a giant dashboard or separate productivity platform. Features should feel native where possible, remain modular, and be individually configurable.

A user should be able to enable everything and get a powerful ChatGPT workspace, or disable almost everything and keep only a few lightweight features such as Favorites and Folders.

### Hard Rules

- Fully free and open source.
- No paid tier.
- No subscriptions.
- No feature paywalls.
- No artificial usage limits.
- No ads.
- No telemetry by default.
- No extension account requirement.
- No mandatory cloud service.
- Firefox and Floorp are the only supported browsers initially.
- Chrome/Chromium support may be considered later.
- Existing planned features are considered **locked baseline features** unless explicitly changed.
- Future ideas are additions by default, not replacements/removals.
- All major features and UI elements must be toggleable/configurable where practical.
- Core functionality must work without AI.
- Core functionality must work without the optional native companion.
- AI must never automatically send a prompt without user action.
- The extension should enhance ChatGPT rather than recreate ChatGPT.

Destructive operations must require appropriate confirmation.

---

# 19. Trashcan / Safe Deletion

Wolf Expansion should not immediately delete chats when the user chooses its delete action.

Planned behavior:

- Extension delete action becomes **Move to Trash**.
- Trashed chats receive a protected system tag:
  - `Trashed`
- The `Trashed` tag:
  - Cannot be manually deleted.
  - Cannot be renamed.
  - Cannot be applied manually to normal chats.
- Trashed chats disappear from normal views by default.
- Dedicated Trash view.
- Default retention: **30 days**.
- Retention period configurable.
- Automatic permanent deletion configurable.
- Manual Restore.
- Moving a chat out of Trash restores it.
- Sending a new message in a trashed conversation automatically restores it.
- Merely opening/reading a trashed chat does not restore it.
- Restore removes the `Trashed` system tag.
- Optional final local backup before permanent purge.
- If permanent ChatGPT deletion cannot be performed safely due to a site change, mark the item as purge-pending rather than risking deletion of the wrong conversation.

---

# 20. Archive Improvements

Planned features:

- Better local archive filtering.
- Archive categories.
- Restore shortcuts.
- Bulk archive.
- Archive by age later.
- Exclude favorites from automatic archival.
- Optional future rules such as:
  - Archive chats untouched for X months.

Automatic archival should be disabled by default.

---

# 21. Counters

Optional utilities:

- Character count.
- Word count.
- Code line count.
- Approximate token count.
- Selected-text statistics.
- Conversation size estimate.

Counters should be individually toggleable.

---

# 22. Message Collapsing

Planned features:

- Collapse individual assistant messages.
- Collapse individual user messages.
- Collapse code blocks.
- Collapse images.
- Collapse tool outputs where detectable.
- Store collapse state locally.
- Optional auto-collapse rules.

---

# 23. Keyboard Shortcuts

Planned features:

- Fully configurable shortcuts.
- Detect shortcut conflicts.
- Enable/disable individual shortcuts.

Possible defaults:

```text
Ctrl+Alt+F  Favorite chat
Ctrl+Alt+M  Move to folder
Ctrl+Alt+P  Open prompt library
Alt+Up      Previous prompt
Alt+Down    Next prompt
```

---

# 24. Settings

All major features must be configurable.

Possible sections:

```text
Organization
[x] Favorites
[x] Folders
[x] Tags

Messages
[x] Timestamps
[x] Message bookmarks
[ ] Word counter

AI
[ ] Local AI
[ ] Codex Bridge

Sync
[ ] Local Cloud Folder Sync
```

A user should be able to install the extension and use only:

- Favorites
- Folders

with everything else disabled.

---

# 25. Dashboard

A small dashboard is planned, but it must not become the main product.

Purpose:

- Settings.
- Global search.
- Folder/tag management.
- Prompt library.
- Bookmark manager.
- Trash.
- Backup/restore.
- Sync status.
- AI configuration.
- Extension data overview.

Normal daily usage should remain inside ChatGPT itself.

---

# 26. Backup System

Backup is a dedicated subsystem, not just an Export button.

Planned features:

- Automatic versioned metadata snapshots.
- Backup before destructive operations.
- Full extension-state backup.
- Partial restore where practical.
- Manual backup.
- Manual restore.
- Backup retention settings.
- Backup corruption detection where practical.
- Keep backups logically separate from live sync state.

---

# 27. Local Cloud Folder Sync

This feature means synchronization through a folder chosen by the user.

Examples:

- OneDrive local synced folder.
- Google Drive for Desktop folder.
- Dropbox folder.
- Syncthing folder.
- NAS-mounted folder.
- Ordinary local folder.

The extension does not need to operate its own cloud server.

## Goals

Synchronize extension metadata such as:

- Settings.
- Favorites.
- Folders/subfolders.
- Tags.
- Notes.
- Bookmarks.
- Prompt library.
- Trash state.
- Smart folders.
- Smart tags.
- AI metadata.
- Dashboard configuration.
- Search/index metadata where appropriate.

Possible assets:

- Saved/generated images.
- Other media.
- Export bundles.

## Conflict Handling

Do not rely on every device repeatedly overwriting one large `data.json`.

Prefer a device-aware operation journal or merge-friendly structure.

Example:

```text
WolfExpansion/
├── manifest.json
├── devices/
│   ├── desktop-7f2a/
│   │   └── operations/
│   └── laptop-a41c/
│       └── operations/
├── snapshots/
├── assets/
│   └── <sha256>...
└── backup/
```

Goals:

- Avoid OneDrive/Google Drive conflict-copy chaos.
- Allow two devices to make changes independently.
- Deterministically merge compatible updates.
- Detect actual conflicts.
- Preserve recent known-good snapshots.
- Use unique device IDs.

The optional Rust native companion may provide filesystem access.

## Fallback

Even if automatic local cloud-folder sync is delayed or not implemented immediately:

- Full data export must exist.
- Full data import must exist.
- Backup/restore must exist.

---

# 

```
# 27A. Multi-Account / Account Switching

Wolf Expansion may provide optional multi-account support for ChatGPT, inspired by account-switching extensions such as RoSeal.

This feature must remain optional. Wolf Expansion itself does **not** require a separate extension account.

## Goals

Allow the user to keep multiple ChatGPT accounts available and switch between them without repeatedly logging out and manually signing back in.

Planned features:

- Multiple saved account slots.
- One-click account switching.
- Account-specific display name/avatar where safely available.
- Clear indication of which ChatGPT account is currently active.
- Add a currently signed-in ChatGPT account as an account slot.
- Remove an individual account slot without affecting other saved accounts.
- Log out an individual account.
- Optional account ordering.
- Optional account nicknames for easier identification.
- Account-management UI in Wolf Expansion settings.
- Quick account switcher accessible from ChatGPT where practical.
- Support many account slots.
- Initial design target of up to roughly 100 account slots where browser capabilities permit.
- No artificial paid/account-count limits imposed by Wolf Expansion.

## Session Isolation

Do not implement account switching by copying raw ChatGPT authentication tokens into normal Wolf Expansion storage.

Prefer browser-supported isolation.

For Firefox/Floorp, a likely architecture is:

```text
Wolf Expansion Account Manager
│
├── Account Slot A
│   ├── isolated browser/container session
│   └── Wolf account scope A
│
├── Account Slot B
│   ├── isolated browser/container session
│   └── Wolf account scope B
│
└── Account Slot C
    ├── isolated browser/container session
    └── Wolf account scope C
```

Possible technologies:

- Firefox contextual identities / containers.
- Separate browser cookie stores.
- Browser-supported session isolation.

The browser should retain the actual ChatGPT login session where possible.

Wolf Expansion should retain only the metadata needed to associate an account slot with its isolated browser session.

Do not persist:

- ChatGPT access tokens.
- ChatGPT session tokens.
- Authentication headers.
- Copied login cookies inside normal extension metadata.
- Private API credentials.

## Account-Scoped Wolf Data

All ChatGPT-account-specific Wolf Expansion data must remain isolated between accounts.

Examples:

- Quick Access membership.
- Folders and subfolders.
- Conversation metadata.
- Tags.
- Notes.
- Message bookmarks.
- Trash state.
- Prompt/chat-specific metadata.
- Account-specific sidebar state.
- Account-specific organizational settings where appropriate.
- Search/index metadata tied to conversations.
- AI-generated metadata tied to conversations.

Example:

```
Account A
├── Quick Access A
├── Folders A
└── Tags A

Account B
├── Quick Access B
├── Folders B
└── Tags B
```

Account B must never display Account A's conversation-specific data.

## Logged-Out State

When ChatGPT is logged out:

- Do not display conversation-specific Quick Access data from the previously active account.
- Do not expose folders containing inaccessible conversations.
- Do not delete the previous account's Wolf metadata merely because the user logged out.
- Global Wolf Expansion settings may remain available.
- Account-specific data should return when the matching account becomes active again.

If the active ChatGPT account cannot be identified safely and confidently:

**fail closed and do not display account-owned conversation data.**

## Account Switching

Switching accounts should:

1. Resolve the requested saved account slot.
2. Open/switch to its isolated ChatGPT browser session.
3. Reset transient Wolf Expansion state from the previous account.
4. Load the selected account's Wolf metadata scope.
5. Reconcile that account's currently available conversations.
6. Render only data belonging to that account.

Transient state that must not cross account boundaries includes:

- Open Wolf menus.
- Native action targets.
- Rename drafts.
- Active conversation state.
- Drag/drop state.
- Temporary title previews.
- Pending native-menu delegation.

No account switch should briefly render the previous account's Quick Access data.

## Data Safety

Account identity must be treated separately from conversation identity.

Conceptually:

```
account scope
    └── conversation ID
            └── Wolf metadata
```

A conversation ID by itself must not be assumed to belong to whichever account happens to be active.

Account removal should not silently destroy local Wolf data unless the user explicitly chooses to remove that account's stored extension data.

Where practical, offer separate choices such as:

```
Remove account session
Remove account session + Wolf data
```

Destructive account-data removal must require confirmation.

## Backup and Sync

Backup/export should preserve account boundaries.

Example:

```
WolfExpansion/
├── global/
├── accounts/
│   ├── <account-scope-a>/
│   └── <account-scope-b>/
└── devices/
```

Local Cloud Folder Sync must not merge conversation metadata from different ChatGPT accounts into one undifferentiated namespace.

Account/session credentials themselves should not be included in normal Wolf Expansion backups or cloud-folder synchronization.

## Privacy

Multi-account support must preserve the existing Wolf Expansion privacy principles:

- No Wolf Expansion account required.
- No extension-operated account server.
- No mandatory cloud service.
- No telemetry requirement.
- No advertising.
- No selling or sharing account-session data.
- No private ChatGPT API dependency.
- No raw authentication-token storage for account switching.

The feature should use browser-supported session isolation wherever practical.

---

# 28. Privacy Controls

Planned privacy page/status display.

Example:

```text
Stored locally:
✓ Folders
✓ Favorites
✓ Tags
✓ Notes
✓ Search index

Sent externally:
Nothing
```

If Codex is enabled:

```text
Codex Bridge:
Only explicitly submitted content is sent.
```

If Local AI is enabled:

```text
Local AI:
Runs on-device.
```

Principles:

- No hidden telemetry.
- No advertising.
- No remote tracking.
- No mandatory analytics.
- No account required.

---

# 29. Local AI

Local AI is optional.

Possible uses:

- Suggest folder.
- Suggest tags.
- Automatically create tags.
- Automatically apply tags.
- Suggest conversation title.
- Summarize conversation.
- Related-chat discovery.
- Semantic search.
- Duplicate/near-duplicate detection.
- Smart folder suggestions.
- Smart tag suggestions.
- Prompt enhancement.
- Prompt generation.
- Idea generation.

The model must not load unless the user enables the feature.

---

# 30. Automatic AI Tagging

Planned features:

- AI automatically suggests tags.
- AI can automatically apply tags.
- AI can create new tags.
- Confidence threshold configurable.
- Auto-create tags independently toggleable.
- Auto-apply tags independently toggleable.
- AI should not silently remove manual tags.
- AI and manual tags can coexist.
- AI-created tags store `origin: ai`.

---

# 31. AI-Generated Indicator

Generated organization objects may display:

```text
✨
```

Examples:

- `✨ Rust`
- `✨ Related Projects`
- `✨ Coding`

Planned behavior:

- AI-created tags can display `✨`.
- AI-created smart folders can display `✨`.
- AI-created organizational objects can display `✨`.
- Indicator can be disabled globally.
- The actual origin must still be stored internally even if the visual indicator is disabled.

---

# 32. Local Embedding Model

Embeddings should be separate from the generative local model.

Possible uses:

- Semantic conversation search.
- Related conversations.
- Conversation clustering.
- Smart folders.
- Duplicate detection.
- Similarity matching.

A small local embedding model may be preferable to a full LLM for these tasks.

---

# 33. Smart Folders

Possible examples:

```text
✨ Recently Active
✨ Coding
✨ WGH
✨ Chats With Images
✨ Chats From Last 7 Days
```

Smart folders may be based on:

- Manual rules.
- Tags.
- Dates.
- Favorites.
- Content type.
- AI classification.
- Embedding similarity.

Possible rule example:

```text
tag = rust
AND
updated < 30 days
```

Smart folders should be optional.

---

# 34. Smart Tags

Possible features:

- Rule-generated tags.
- AI-generated tags.
- Automatically updated tags.
- Generated indicator.
- Manual override.
- Disable per tag.
- Convert generated tag to manual tag.

---

# 35. Local Mini LLM

Optional downloadable model.

Possible modes:

```text
Local Model

○ Off
● Lightweight
○ Balanced
○ Custom
```

Potential use cases:

- Short summaries.
- Folder suggestions.
- Tag suggestions.
- Chat title suggestions.
- Prompt improvement.
- Prompt writing.
- Idea generation.

Do not bundle a large model into the base extension package.

---

# 36. Enhance Prompt

AI-assisted composer feature.

Workflow:

1. User writes a prompt.
2. User clicks **Enhance Prompt**.
3. AI improves structure, clarity, specificity, or formatting.
4. The improved version is shown/inserted.
5. User chooses whether to use it.
6. The extension never sends it automatically.

Planned features:

- Local AI support.
- Optional Codex support.
- Undo to original.
- Preview/diff mode.
- Accept/reject.
- Enhancement styles:
  - Concise
  - Detailed
  - Coding
  - Research
  - Creative
  - Preserve wording
- Custom enhancement instructions later.

---

# 37. AI Write Prompt

AI can build a full prompt from a rough idea.

Example input:

```text
find why my Rust app leaks memory
```

Possible output:

```text
Review the following Rust application for likely memory-retention or resource-lifetime issues...
```

Behavior:

- Insert into composer.
- Never auto-send.
- User can edit before sending.
- Local AI or optional Codex provider.

---

# 38. AI Suggestions / Idea Generator

Optional manually opened AI helper.

Possible uses:

- Prompt ideas.
- Follow-up ideas.
- Project brainstorming.
- Alternative approaches.
- Organization suggestions.
- Context-aware suggestions for the current conversation when enabled.

It should not permanently clutter the ChatGPT interface.

---

# 39. AI Provider Architecture

AI features should not be tightly coupled to one provider.

Possible internal design:

```text
AIProvider
├── NoneProvider
├── LocalModelProvider
└── CodexProvider
```

Possible later providers:

- Ollama
- LM Studio
- Other fully local/open integrations

No provider should be required for core features.

---

# 40. Codex Bridge

Optional advanced feature.

Possible architecture:

```text
Firefox Extension
      ↓
Firefox Native Messaging
      ↓
Wolf Expansion Bridge (Rust)
      ↓
Codex CLI
```

Possible features:

- Analyze selected conversation.
- Deep organization suggestions.
- Code-heavy conversation summaries.
- Send selected code to Codex.
- Advanced prompt enhancement.
- Advanced prompt writing.
- Create files/project output where explicitly requested.
- Future workspace integrations.

The extension should use supported Codex interfaces only.

Do not build around:

- scraping private ChatGPT APIs,
- stealing session tokens,
- undocumented browser-auth tricks.

---

# 41. Provider Fallback

Possible optional configuration:

```text
AI Provider

○ None
● Local AI
○ Codex
○ Local + Codex fallback
```

For fallback mode:

- Try local AI first.
- Use Codex only when explicitly allowed.
- Clearly show when content will leave the device.
- Never silently send entire chats externally.

---

# 42. Native-Looking ChatGPT Integration

Where possible, features should appear in existing ChatGPT UI.

Example chat menu:

```text
Share
Rename
Archive
────────────
⭐ Add to Favorites
📁 Add to Folder >
🏷 Tags >
📝 Add Note
────────────
🗑 Move to Trash
```

The extension should avoid requiring a separate management screen for ordinary actions.

---

# 43. DOM Resilience

ChatGPT is a React application and its DOM/CSS can change frequently.

Use a dedicated adapter layer rather than spreading fragile selectors across the codebase.

Possible design:

```text
ChatGPTAdapter
├── findSidebar()
├── findConversationMenu()
├── getConversationId()
├── getConversationLink()
├── getMessageElements()
├── findComposer()
└── watchNavigation()
```

Principles:

- Prefer stable URLs and semantic attributes.
- Avoid relying on generated CSS class names.
- Use `MutationObserver` where needed.
- Centralize ChatGPT-specific DOM logic.
- Fail safely when ChatGPT changes.

---

# 44. Modular Feature System

Possible source structure:

```text
src/
├── core/
├── adapters/
├── storage/
├── sync/
├── dashboard/
├── settings/
├── features/
│   ├── favorites/
│   ├── folders/
│   ├── tags/
│   ├── notes/
│   ├── bookmarks/
│   ├── timestamps/
│   ├── navigator/
│   ├── drafts/
│   ├── trash/
│   ├── export/
│   ├── prompts/
│   └── ai/
└── native/
```

Each major feature should be possible to disable independently where practical.

---

# 45. Storage Model

Extension metadata should be keyed to stable ChatGPT conversation IDs whenever possible.

Example conceptual record:

```text
conversation
├── favorite state
├── folders
├── tags
├── notes
├── bookmarks
├── trash metadata
├── timestamps
├── AI metadata
├── summary
└── sync revision
```

Possible storage technologies:

- WebExtension `storage.local`
- IndexedDB for larger/indexed data
- Optional native sync directory via Rust companion

---

# 46. Settings Portability

Settings should be included in:

- Manual export.
- Full backup.
- Local cloud sync when enabled.

Settings should support sensible migration between extension versions.

---

# 47. Feature Backing / Recovery Support

Important features should have backing data so that one broken UI state does not destroy user organization.

Examples:

- Versioned metadata.
- Backup before destructive changes.
- Sync revisions.
- Import validation.
- Trash retention metadata.
- AI-origin metadata.
- Stable IDs.
- Migration support.

---

# 48. Error Handling

Planned principles:

- Never silently lose metadata.
- Never delete a ChatGPT conversation if the extension is unsure which chat is targeted.
- Show recoverable errors.
- Keep failed sync operations queued.
- Preserve last known-good state.
- Detect incompatible/corrupt backup files.
- Prefer safe failure over destructive guesses.

---

# 49. Performance

The extension must stay lightweight even with many features.

Principles:

- Disabled features should consume effectively no ongoing work.
- Avoid scanning the entire DOM unnecessarily.
- Lazy-load expensive modules.
- Lazy-load AI models.
- Index chats incrementally.
- Avoid enormous UI frameworks unless genuinely justified.
- Avoid unnecessary background polling.
- Use caching intelligently.
- Keep the normal ChatGPT experience responsive.

---

# 50. Accessibility

Planned considerations:

- Keyboard navigation.
- Screen-reader-friendly controls where practical.
- Proper labels.
- Avoid color-only status indicators.
- Configurable animations.
- Respect reduced-motion settings.
- Maintain usable contrast.

---

# 51. UI Customization

Possible configurable UI options:

- Section ordering.
- Sidebar section visibility.
- Compact/comfortable density.
- Folder icons.
- Folder colors.
- Tag colors.
- Generated `✨` marker.
- Dashboard modules.
- Hover previews.
- Number of title lines.
- Sidebar width.
- Animation toggles.

The extension should avoid forcing a custom theme.

---

# 52. Browser Support

Initial supported browsers:

- Firefox
- Floorp

Later consideration:

- Chrome
- Chromium browsers

Initial development should prioritize Firefox-native WebExtension APIs rather than introducing unnecessary cross-browser abstraction immediately.

---

# 53. Publishing

Planned distribution:

- Mozilla Add-ons (AMO)
- GitHub source repository
- GitHub releases if useful

The project should not require paying to publish.

---

# 54. Licensing

Preferred direction:

- GPL-3.0

Reason:

Keep redistributed modified versions open source and discourage closed-source paid forks based directly on the project.

Final license can still be decided before public release.

---

# 55. Explicit Non-Goals

Do **not** add:

- Paid plans.
- Subscriptions.
- Feature paywalls.
- Ads.
- Crypto.
- Prompt marketplace.
- Social network.
- Mandatory account.
- Mandatory cloud sync.
- Forced AI.
- Giant replacement dashboard.
- Custom chatbot replacing ChatGPT.
- Hidden telemetry.
- Remote tracking.
- Unnecessary all-sites browser permissions.
- Heavy UI frameworks without a real need.
- Automatic AI submission without user confirmation.

# Final Design Goal

**Powerful when enabled. Almost invisible when disabled.**

A minimal user should be able to run only:

```text
⭐ Favorites
📁 Folders
```

A power user should eventually be able to run:

```text
Organization
Search
Notes
Bookmarks
Trash
Backups
Local Cloud Sync
Prompt Library
Semantic Search
Local AI
Smart Folders
Smart Tags
Codex Integration
```

without any feature being locked behind payment.
